Background information
----------------------
The follow set of scripts are used to work with OpenSSL in a large
(distributed) PKI environment.  It is a collection of scripts that were useful
to me and that I want to share here.


read_cert_chains.py
-------------------
Will print the contents of the /etc/grid-security/certificates and pretty print
it.  In the code you'll have to state if you want to match all the *.0 files or
*.pem. This is relative to the version of the IGTF distribution.
